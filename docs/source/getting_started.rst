Getting Started
===============

Welcome to EnTiSe, the framework for generating timeseries data for HVAC, Electricity, Mobility, and Occupancy types. This guide will walk you through the basics of setting up and using EnTiSe for the first time.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before getting started, ensure you have:

- Python 3.8 or higher installed.
- EnTiSe installed. If not, refer to the :ref:`installation` guide.

Quickstart Example
------------------

EnTiSe was designed to allow users to generate time series quickly for multiple objects.
Therefore, the tool focuses on batch processing so that users do not have to deal with aspects such as
multiprocessing but can focus on defining the time series they need. However, the tool also allows to use
the methods directly if they need more control. Below you find an example for both ways to get you started quickly.

Batch Processing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In batch processing you define all the parameters for all time series types beforehand and then create them all at once.
This is a simple example for one object and one time series type but you can extend it to thousands and millions of
time series.

1. **Import the Required Components**

Start by importing the necessary classes:

.. code-block:: python

    from entise.core.generator import TimeSeriesGenerator
    import pandas as pd

2. **Prepare Input Data**

Define objects (metadata) and timeseries data that EnTiSe will process:

.. code-block:: python

    # Define an object for HVAC
    object_row = {
        "id": "building1",
        "hvac": "1R1C",
        "resistance": 2.0,
        "capacitance": 1e5,
        "temp_init": 20.0,
        "temp_min": 20.0,
        "temp_max": 24.0,
        "power_heating": 3000.0,
        "power_cooling": 3000.0,
    }

    # Mock weather data
    index = pd.date_range(start="2025-01-01", periods=24, freq="h", tz="UTC")
    weather_df = pd.DataFrame({
        "datetime": index,
        "temp_out": [0.0] * 24,
    }, index=index)

    # Combine into a dictionary
    data = {"weather": weather_df}

3. **Create and Run the Generator**

Use the `TimeSeriesGenerator` to process your objects and data:

.. code-block:: python

    # Initialize the generator
    gen = TimeSeriesGenerator()

    # Add the object(s)
    gen.add_objects(object_row)

    # Generate timeseries
    summary, df = gen.generate(data, workers=1)

4. **View the Results**

The `summary` will contain summary metrics, and `timeseries` will hold the generated data:

.. code-block:: python

    print("Summary Metrics:")
    print(summary)

    print("\nTimeseries Data:")
    print(df)

Expected Output:

.. code-block:: text

    Summary Metrics:
                                 hvac_energy_demand  hvac_power_demand
    building1                                  72.0               3000

    Timeseries Data:
                             hvac_energy_demand  hvac_power_demand  hvac_temperature
    2025-01-01 00:00:00+00:00                3.0             3000.0              20.0
    2025-01-01 01:00:00+00:00                3.0             3000.0              20.0
    2025-01-01 02:00:00+00:00                3.0             3000.0              20.0
    ...                                       ...               ...               ...

Direct Method Access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to using the TimeSeriesGenerator for batch processing, you can also directly import and use methods:

.. code-block:: python

    # Import a specific method
    from entise.methods.pv import PVLib

    # Create an instance
    pvlib = PVLib()

    # Method 1: Using dictionaries
    obj = {
        "id": "pv_system_1",
        "latitude": 48.1,
        "longitude": 11.6,
        "power": 5000,  # 5 kW system
        "azimuth": 180,  # South-facing
        "tilt": 30,
    }
    data = {
        "weather": weather_df,  # DataFrame with solar radiation data
    }
    result = pvlib.generate(obj, data)

    # Method 2: Using named parameters directly
    result = pvlib.generate(
        latitude=48.1,
        longitude=11.6,
        power=5000,
        azimuth=180,
        tilt=30,
        weather=weather_df
    )

    # Method 3: Combining both approaches
    obj = {"latitude": 48.1, "longitude": 11.6}
    data = {"weather": weather_df}
    result = pvlib.generate(
        obj=obj,
        data=data,
        power=5000,  # This overrides any "power" value in obj
        azimuth=180,
        tilt=30
    )

    # Access results
    summary = result["summary"]
    timeseries = result["timeseries"]

    print("Summary Metrics:")
    print(summary)

    print("\nTimeseries Data:")
    print(timeseries)

This approach is useful when you want to:

1. Work with a single method directly
2. Have more control over the generation process
3. Integrate EnTiSe methods into your own workflows

Understanding the Workflow
--------------------------

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how EnTiSe processes your data:

1. **Objects**: Define the metadata for the timeseries you want to generate.
2. **Input Data**: Provide the required timeseries data (e.g., weather data, occupancy data).
3. **Method Selection**: EnTiSe selects the appropriate method based on the object properties.
4. **Strategy Selection**: For auxiliary calculations (like solar gains or internal gains), EnTiSe selects the most appropriate strategy based on the available data.
5. **Pipeline Processing**: Methods are executed in a pipeline, with dependencies automatically resolved.
6. **Outputs**: EnTiSe generates summary metrics and detailed timeseries for each object.
